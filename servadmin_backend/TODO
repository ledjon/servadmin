# TODO List for servadmin_backend

- Implement service keys (authentication) (DONE)

- Stats/logs (awstats, most likely)

- Add some type of 'suspend' system where:
  a) Their account gets locked (password)
  b) Their site becomes unavaible (point doc root to some 'disabled' page)

- Add support for vpostfix (after I finish writting vpostfix!)

- Add support for different dns service (perhaps tinydns?)

- PostgreSQL support.

- Site/Database backups

- Add *lots* of validation on various inputs (in the works)
